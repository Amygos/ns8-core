# UI library

Since core and modules UI share multiple components and features, these facilities have been aggregated into NPM package [@nethserver/ns8-ui-lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nethserver/ns8-ui-lib).
The reusable UI components included in the library are easily recognizable since their name starts with `Ns` prefix, e.g. `NsButton`, `NsInlineNotification`.
The library also includes a set of VueJs mixins used by core and modules to access utility functions and perform common tasks.

Source code of UI library is provided [here](https://github.com/NethServer/ns8-ui-lib).
